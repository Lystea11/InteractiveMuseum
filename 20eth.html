            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In this document we will be analysing three sources and explaining their prupose, mission, and limitation. It is important for us to write this because these three sources provide the information for all of the other pages, and if there is a heavily biased opinion or outdated information that could lead to misinformation.</p>

            <h2>"Timeline of the British Empire" | Historic UK:</h2>
            <p>The article "Timeline of the British Empire" is a credible article from Historic UK that is intended to be used in historical research. It is relatively biased as it states in the mission that it intends to allow for history enthusiasts to understand more about British history. This article is relevant because it explains the timeline and impact of the British Empire, but is limited in that it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the Empire's legacy or diverse perspectives.</p>

            <h2>Challenges Caused by a Monarchist Government:</h2>
            <p>Having a Monarchist government was very popular back in the sixteenth through 18th century but there are some very obvious reasons why it is not so popular anymore and a democratic government took over most first-world countries. To list some of them there were problems with Absolutism, where one Monarch with the wrong intentions could quickly turn the country Tyrannical. We can see this with King Louis XIV of France who declared  "L'Ã‰tat, c'est moi" ("I am the state"). We have also seen problems with a stubbornness to change, and a willpower to stick to traditions very similar to what we see in Republicans today, though back in the 18th century this meant ignoring necessary reforms and modernization efforts which held back countless nations from developing at a quicker pace.</p>
            <h2>Relevancy of the British Monarchy Today:</h2>
            <p>As we have talked about the cons of a Monarchy government, having a head or kingpin of a nation could be very useful for things like keeping thousand-year-old traditions, having shared Values and Principles with the people and a reminder of their cultural and historical heritage. Monarchies in the present day also exercise soft power and diplomacy, strengthening relationships between commonwealth countries which is important to keep the natural dignity of the crown.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>A Monarchist government has been present through many centuries in history and with many different countries but never like the way we see in the British Empire and present-day Great Britain. Though Monarchies are a thing of the past, having shared values and principles, keeping traditions and overall strengthening diplomacy can be reasons why a light Monarchy could be useful and how it made sense to make a change back in the feudal origins of the British Empire.</p>
